This is a web app where I experimented with **transform** and **transition** in CSS and practiced the **.forEach()** method in JavaScript. 

The idea for this app is to practice animation. As you scroll down, different sections of the website fly onto the screen from outside the viewport. I decided to fill it with images for fun :joy:
